                        <h4>About Project</h4>
                        <p>This project was completed as a part of the Web Development course at Allegheny College. For this project, I implemented a website containing information for every African Country. I had taken a variety of courses about Africa and completed a variety of different projects about it, so I was motivated to create this project to learn more about Africa personally while also helping spread more awareness about African countries. Every African country has a page containing relevant information including the flag, population, capital, and economic indicators.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This website was implemented using web technologies including HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Gatsby. Providing a simple user experience was the main focus while design was taking place.</p>
