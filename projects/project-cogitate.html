                        <p>Cogitate is a free and open source tool written in Python. It is designed to evaluate the level of contributions for members of a GitHub repository. GatorCogitate generates a score for members based on a variety of metrics including lines added, lines deleted, pull requests, issue tracker contributions, and more.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This project was developed by around 40 student developers from Allegheny College during the Spring 2020 Software Engineering course. Students worked together in this large-scale team to design, implement, and test the tool. The tool ended up working extremely well!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I ended up being one of the project's biggest contributors, ending up with the most commits on the repository. I was a Software Architect, responsible for coming up with an efficient and well thought out tool design. I was also the leader of a Web Development team with 8 members. In this role, I worked to delegate tasks to different team members and implement code that would vizualize the metrics gathered/calculated by other teams in a web-based format, using Streamlit.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This project was one of the coolest I have worked on, I hope you check it out!</p>
