# Christian Lussier's Personal Website -- https://christianlussier.netlify.com
The files for work-in progress personal website of Christian Lussier.

## Development Process
I developed this website fairly quickly by using a free template. A link to the designer of this template can be found in the footer of the website. I then customized the template by adding information about myself to the website. I also removed unneeded features.

## Future Plans
This website is currently a work in progress. As a result in the near future I plan to add more content to the website and continue to fine tune it. Most of this content will be located on the index page and includes more of my projects, more blog posts and a link to a dedicated blog page, and a working contact form. If you have any ideas about what I could add to this website, please get in touch with me by email or leave a issue in the issues tab. I would really appreciate it.

## Issues, Feature Ideas, or Concerns?
If you notice any issues, bugs, have ideas about new features for the website, or anything else please let me know. Don't hesitate to leave in issue in the `Issues` tab of this repository or contact me at lussierc@allegheny.edu.

## Accessing the Website
To access the website, there are two main ways this can be done. The easiest way to do this would be to access the website from your internet browser, using this link to access [My Personal Website](https://christianlussier.netlify.com).
